First of all the project is self-oriented. What does it mean? I think this service will not work via online access, only for local usage. It sounds like feature for future updates, but not an aim of this project.

Project format: local web-page (or maybeee an application) with some functional based on local database

Start features:
* entering current earnings
* fill the expenses (periodical and one-time)
* get visual graphs/statistics
